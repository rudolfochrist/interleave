;;; Commentary:

;; In the past, textbooks were sometimes published as 'interleaved' editions.
;; That meant, each page was followed by a blank page and the ambitious student/
;; scholar had the ability to take their notes directly in their copy of the
;; textbook. Newton and Kant were prominent representatives of this technique.

;; Nowadays textbooks (or lecture material) come in PDF format. Although almost
;; every PDF Reader has the ability to add some notes to the PDF itself, it is
;; not as powerful as it could be.

;; This is what this minor mode tries to accomplish. It presents your PDF side by
;; side to an [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] buffer with your notes, narrowing
;; down to just those passages that are relevant to the particular page in the
;; document viewer.

;;; Usage:

;; - Create a Org file that will keep your notes. In the Org headers section, add
;; #+INTERLEAVE_PDF: /the/path/to/your/pdf.pdf
;; - Start `interleave' with `M-x interleave'.
;; - To insert a note for a page, type `i'.
;; - Navigation is the same as in `doc-view-mode'/`pdf-view-mode'."
